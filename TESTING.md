    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main products sold by the ecommerce company

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Shop Now" Call to action button.
        2. The main visual impression of the brand is evident immediately with the hero image.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find products.

        1. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link has a dropdown menu which describes what category they will end up at clearly, alternatively the left hand dropdown menu offers a selection of sort methods.
        2. Users can click on a product of interest to find out more about the product and add their chosen quantity to their basket.

        3. There is a Keep Shopping call to action button at the bottom of each product page to return the customer to the main product page.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for reviews to understand what their customers think of them and see if they are trusted and provide a good level of service. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has visited individual products, the user will be able to see reviews indicating what previous buyers thought about the product.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of most pages on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

        1. These are clearly shown in the product layouts and individual product pages.
        2. Shoppers will be able to find out about new products when they are anounced in the blog.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to buy products form the store and get them delivered.

        1. The individual product pages allow users to add products to their bag.
        2. A toast message will appear to inform the user they have successfully added the product quantity to the bag.

        1. The user can explore the sort methods in the drop down menu on the main navigation and sort products by price rating or category. Each sort optioin has further options such as ordering products from low - high price or alphabetically for example.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up and create my own account.

        1. Users can set up an account at any time. This would be more relevant to users who buy often and like the speed and convenience of ordering whilst logged into their account. They can also keep a record of past users and their delivery details are autosaved.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed information about any new products.

        1. The home page displays a structured navigation with sotrting and filtering functionality, enabling shoppers to find products easily.
        2. Product pages display an image and a clear desription of the product which can be easily added to a basket which is displayed in a modal to the top right of the page. 

    2. As a Site Owner, I want to establish a reular customer base who return and make regular purchases.
        1. Customers can create their own account through the sign-up page and save their details. They can also see a list of previous purchases within the account layout
        2. The blog informs customers to recently added products and nutritional benefits of products.

    3. As a Site Owner, I want products to be stocked in high street shops and keep track of stock held by partners.
        1. The stockists app lists high street vendors who stock the Nutritionist's products.
        <img src="media/stockists-list.png">
        2. The shop owner/superuser can update the list manually in the admin area to indicate whether a partner has products or is out of stock. Future development would see this functionality to be developed to indicate what products are in stock and eventually into an automated inventory system.

### Bugs and Error testing

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.


### Solved Bugs
- I had two paths for the Subscribe App. The path in the Subscribe app urls.py should have been empty rather entered as 'subscribe' , the result being two paths to the Nutritionist urls.py file and one of them could not be identified by Django causing an error.

### Known Bugs

-   sorting products

- When a user signs up for a newsltter and already has items already in the basket - the apperance of the success message appears as if it is part of the products modal.
